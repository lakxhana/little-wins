# How to Verify AI is Being Used (Not Hardcoded)

## Quick Verification Methods

### 1. **Browser Console Logs** 🔍
Open your browser's Developer Console (F12 or Cmd+Option+I) and look for these logs when you type a task:

```
🤖 AI: Analyzing task with Groq AI... {task: "...", energyLevel: "..."}
🌐 [Groq API] Making HTTP request to: https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions
📤 [Groq API] Request payload: {model: "llama-3.1-8b-instant", messageLength: ...}
📡 [Groq API] Response status: 200 OK
✅ [Groq API] Received analysis response
✅ AI: Analysis complete {difficulty: "...", time: "...", ...}
```

**If you see these logs = AI is working! ✅**
**If you DON'T see these logs = AI is NOT being called ❌**

### 2. **Network Tab** 🌐
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to the **Network** tab
3. Type a task in the input field
4. Look for a request to `api.groq.com`
5. Check the request:
   - **URL**: `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions`
   - **Method**: `POST`
   - **Status**: `200 OK`
   - **Request Payload**: Contains your task text and prompt
   - **Response**: Contains AI-generated JSON with analysis/breakdown

**If you see this request = AI is working! ✅**

### 3. **Visual Indicators** 👁️
Look for these in the UI:
- **"🤖 AI Analyzing..."** text when analyzing
- **"✓ Powered by Groq AI"** badge after analysis completes
- Different results for similar tasks (AI generates unique responses)

### 4. **Test with Different Tasks** 🧪
Try these tests:
- Type "apply for a job" → Should get AI breakdown with 5 steps
- Type "buy groceries" → Should get different analysis
- Type "write essay" → Should get unique breakdown each time

**If results vary = AI is working! ✅**
**If results are identical = Might be hardcoded ❌**

### 5. **Check API Key** 🔑
1. Check if `REACT_APP_GROQ_API_KEY` is set in your `.env` file
2. If API key is missing, you'll see an error in console
3. Without API key, AI won't work (code will return early)

### 6. **Code Inspection** 💻
Check these files to verify AI usage:

**`src/services/groqService.ts`**
- Line 30: `sendMessageToGroq()` - Makes actual HTTP request to Groq API
- Line 98: `analyzeTaskWithGroq()` - Calls AI for task analysis
- Line 172: `breakDownTaskWithGroq()` - Calls AI for task breakdown

**`src/components/dashboard/TaskInput.jsx`**
- Line 5: Imports AI functions from groqService
- Line 62: `await analyzeTaskWithGroq(...)` - Calls AI
- Line 138: `await breakDownTaskWithGroq(...)` - Calls AI

**No hardcoded values** - All analysis comes from AI responses!

## What's NOT Hardcoded

✅ **Task Analysis** - Difficulty, time, XP, tips all come from AI
✅ **Task Breakdown** - All 5 steps generated by AI
✅ **ADHD Tips** - Generated by AI based on task
✅ **Step Details** - Each step is AI-generated and unique

## What IS Validated (Not Hardcoded)

The code has **validation** (not hardcoded defaults) that only runs if:
- AI returns invalid/malformed JSON
- AI response is missing required fields
- This is a safety fallback, not the primary source

See `src/services/groqService.ts` lines 144-158 for validation logic.

## Troubleshooting

**No AI logs in console?**
- Check if API key is set: `console.log(process.env.REACT_APP_GROQ_API_KEY)`
- Check Network tab for failed requests
- Check console for error messages

**AI not working?**
- Verify API key is valid
- Check internet connection
- Look for error messages in console
- Check Groq API status

## Summary

**AI is being used if:**
1. ✅ You see console logs with 🤖 emoji
2. ✅ Network tab shows requests to `api.groq.com`
3. ✅ Results vary for different tasks
4. ✅ You see "Powered by Groq AI" badge
5. ✅ API key is set in environment

**AI is NOT being used if:**
1. ❌ No console logs
2. ❌ No network requests to Groq
3. ❌ Identical results for all tasks
4. ❌ Error messages about missing API key
